# ML_Projects
Machine Learning is fun and here are some of the Projects that I did for the Beigner's Level.

1. House Price Prediction 
  The dataset is used from sklearn library in Python.
  The House data is of the Boston House Prices. 
  ~ We use this data as both Training and Testing data.
      We tale 0.8 ie 80% of the data as the Training Data and rest i.e 0.2 20% as he Testing data for the model.
  ~ Here in this model we classify and predict the Price on the basis of CRIME RATE in the area i.e "CRIM" in the model.
  -> Packeges used :    1. Numpy
                        2. Pandas
                        3. Matplotlib
                        4. Pyplot
                        5. Sklearn
                        5. Scipy
                        6. Plotly - express, io, graphn_objects
